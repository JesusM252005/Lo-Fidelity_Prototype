                The Chromium Effect exhibition explores the retro styles of vehicles through replicated models and diecasts that seem almost so real as the authentic versions. 
                Although the items are small, they truly revive the essence of vehicles from the 90’s through the early 2000’s, full of fine detail and lots of chrome. 
                This exhibition allows the audience to get a hold of the past and to demonstrate to every generation what the street vehicle era was like then. 
                The Chromium effect showcases a variety of vehicles with multiple features , each with its own unique vibrancy.

                 A well known style from the 90’s through 00’s that the exhibition showcases is vehicles with DUB rims. 
                 Dubbed rim cars are an important style through this exhibition because this era turned regular cars into a piece of luxury, incorporating large oversized rims to demonstrate character. 
                 Lowriders are another main feature of The Chromium Effect exhibition as well. Since the 1930’s, Lowriders have made a great impact upon car culture, covered with bright colors, clean interiors, high detail, and lots of chrome. 
                 Lowriders are a symbol of resistance and more than just being a car, Lowriders are a live mural showcasing heritage, family, and communities, for all to enjoy.
